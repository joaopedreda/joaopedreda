👋 Hi, I’m @joaopedreda!

👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Web Development, Wordpress Development, Generative Art, Photography, and Pro Wrestling.

🌱 I’m currently doing the Odin Project Course. 

💞️ I’ll be looking to collaborate on ways to mix generative art and phtoography, eventually. <em>Would love to do that now, but I still need to learn a fair bit until then! </em>
